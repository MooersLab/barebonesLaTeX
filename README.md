# bare bones LaTeX template document

Sometimes you need to prepare just a simple document. 
This repo contains an example of a simple file template that does not have any external file requirements beyond some standard packages that come with a texlive LaTeX distribution. 
Nonetheless, it supports the use of the following features:

* equations
* figures
* tables
* a references cited section.

This file could easily evolve into a manuscript.
